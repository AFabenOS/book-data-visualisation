# Things to fix / address:
- Need to account for contractions and keeping apostrophes (didn't, you'd, can't) 
- Need to account for hyphenated words (non-existent). 
- Some words have combined which would detract from a true count 
('jordanconstrained' should be 'jordan', 'constrained'). Not sure how to deal with this
other than on a case by case basis, since using a dictionary to check for actual
words would remove the names of fictional places, words, or even foreign texts
- Noticed 'jug jug' exists when it should either end up being 'jugjug' or 
'jug', 'jug'
- Roman numerals as chapters could be impacting true count (ASCII)
# FIXED
- Floating 'j's in text  (could be fixed by removing all single letters that aren't
'a' or 'i')
